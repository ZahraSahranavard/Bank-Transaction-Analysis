# Bank Transaction Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of bank transactions to uncover insights into customer behavior, peak sales times, and top-selling products. 


## Project Overview

The primary goals of this analysis are to answer the following questions:

*   **Q1:** Is there a specific pattern in customer purchase timing (day of the week, time of day)?
*   **Q2:** Which stores have the most sales?
*   **Q3:** What are the best-selling products?
## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the analysis:

*   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
*   `jdatetime`: For converting Shamsi (Jalali) dates to Gregorian dates.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib jdatetime 
```
